Thanks for your interest in Faxbot! Whether you're reporting a bug, requesting a feature, or contributing code, we're here to help.

## Getting Help

**Don't hesitate to open an issue.** Seriously. Faxbot has many moving parts, and we'd rather help you get unstuck than have you struggle alone.

## When Opening an Issue

To help us assist you quickly, please include:

### Your Configuration
- **Backend**: Which backend are you using? (`phaxio`, `sinch`, `sip`, or `FAX_DISABLED=true` for testing)
- **Compliance**: Are you bound by HIPAA requirements, or are you a non-healthcare user?
- **MCP Integration** (if applicable):
  - Which MCP server? (Node.js stdio/HTTP/SSE, or Python stdio/SSE)
  - Which transport? (stdio, HTTP, or SSE+OAuth)

### What Happened
- **Expected behavior**: What did you think would happen?
- **Actual behavior**: What actually happened?
- **Steps to reproduce**: How can we recreate the issue?

### Supporting Information
- **Logs**: Relevant log output (see note about PHI/PII below)
- **Screenshots**: If applicable, especially for UI-related issues
- **Environment**: Docker, local development, cloud deployment?

### ⚠️ Important: Protect PHI/PII
**Never include protected health information (PHI) or personally identifiable information (PII) in issues, logs, or screenshots.** This includes:
- Phone numbers
- Patient names or identifiers  
- Document contents
- API keys or secrets

Redact sensitive information with `[REDACTED]` or `***` before sharing.

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports
Use the issue template and include the configuration details above.

### Feature Requests  
Describe your use case and why the feature would be valuable. Consider which backends it would apply to.

### Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test across relevant backends (see [Testing](#testing))
5. Commit with clear messages
6. Push to your branch
7. Open a Pull Request

## Testing

Faxbot supports multiple backends and configurations. When contributing code:

- **Test Mode**: Use `FAX_DISABLED=true` for development—no actual faxes are sent
- **Backend-Specific**: If your change affects a specific backend, test with that backend
- **MCP Changes**: Test the relevant MCP transport (stdio/HTTP/SSE)
- **SDK Changes**: Test both Node.js and Python SDKs if applicable

## Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use `black` for formatting
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Use ESLint configuration in the project
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs in `docs/` directory

## Security Considerations

Faxbot handles sensitive healthcare data. When contributing:

- Never commit API keys, secrets, or test PHI
- Consider HIPAA implications for new features
- Use secure defaults
- Document security requirements clearly
