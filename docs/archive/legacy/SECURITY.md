# Security

Configuration and guidance for HIPAA‑aligned deployments and OAuth/OIDC setup.

## Webhooks and Callbacks
- Outbound status (Phaxio): `POST /phaxio-callback` with HMAC verification. Keep callback URLs HTTPS.
- Inbound (cloud): `POST /phaxio-inbound` (HMAC) and `POST /sinch-inbound` (not provider‑signed; enforce Basic auth on your endpoint and use IP allowlists). Never disable signature checks where the provider supports them.
- Inbound (self‑hosted): `POST /_internal/asterisk/inbound` with `X-Internal-Secret` on a private network.

## MCP Transports
- HTTP: protect with `MCP_HTTP_API_KEY` and strict `MCP_HTTP_CORS_ORIGIN`.
- SSE: require OAuth2/JWT; configure issuer/audience/JWKS; run behind TLS.
- WebSocket (Node): protect with `MCP_WS_API_KEY` (or `API_KEY`); run behind TLS or an authenticated proxy.
