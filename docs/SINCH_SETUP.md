# SINCH_SETUP.md

Cloud backend using Sinch Fax API v3 ("Phaxio by Sinch"). This backend uploads your PDF directly to Sinch rather than serving a tokenized URL.

When to use
- Prefer this if you have a Sinch account/project and want the v3 direct‑upload flow.
- If you signed up at Phaxio and were redirected to Sinch, your credentials generally work here. You will also need your Sinch Project ID.

Sign‑up and Console (important)
- Use the Sinch Customer (Build) Dashboard — this is where the Fax API lives and where you create access keys and find your Project ID:
  - https://dashboard.sinch.com/settings/access-keys
- Other Sinch portals (Messaging, Developer portal, etc.) do not expose Fax API access keys and will cause confusion.

Key differences vs `phaxio` backend
- `phaxio`: Provider fetches your PDF via `PUBLIC_API_URL` and posts status to `/phaxio-callback` (HMAC verification supported). No Sinch project ID required.
- `sinch`: Faxbot uploads your PDF directly to Sinch (multipart). PUBLIC_API_URL and `/phaxio-callback` are not used. Webhook integration for Sinch is under evaluation; current builds reflect the provider’s initial status response.

Environment
```
FAX_BACKEND=sinch
SINCH_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
SINCH_API_KEY=your_api_key          # falls back to PHAXIO_API_KEY if unset
SINCH_API_SECRET=your_api_secret    # falls back to PHAXIO_API_SECRET if unset
# Optional override region/base URL:
# SINCH_BASE_URL=https://fax.api.sinch.com/v3
# Outbound auth method (default basic). Use oauth for HIPAA‑aligned setups:
# SINCH_AUTH_METHOD=oauth
# Optional OAuth token endpoint override (region):
# SINCH_AUTH_BASE_URL=https://eu.auth.sinch.com/oauth2/token

# General
API_KEY=your_secure_api_key         # optional but recommended (X-API-Key)
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
```

Create a per-user API key (recommended)
```
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/api-keys \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"local dev","owner":"me","scopes":["fax:send","fax:read"]}'
```
Save the returned `token` (`fbk_live_<keyId>_<secret>`) and use it as `X-API-Key` for client calls.

Send a fax (curl)
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/fax \
  -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
  -F to=+15551234567 \
  -F file=@./example.pdf
```
The response includes a job ID and the `backend: "sinch"` field.

Status updates
- Immediate status is mapped from Sinch’s response. Additional webhook handling may be added later; for now, poll your own app state via `GET /fax/{id}`.

Inbound receiving (optional)
- Enable inbound mode: `INBOUND_ENABLED=true`.
- Configure Sinch inbound webhook to `POST /sinch-inbound`.
- Security: Sinch inbound webhooks are not provider‑signed. Enforce Basic auth (`SINCH_INBOUND_BASIC_USER/PASS`) and add IP allowlists at your edge. Do not configure HMAC for Sinch.
- Stored inbound PDFs can be accessed with a short‑TTL token or an API key with `inbound:read`.

Notes
- Only PDF and TXT files are accepted. Convert images (PNG/JPG) to PDF first.
- Avoid exposing credentials. Place Faxbot behind HTTPS and a reverse proxy with rate limiting.

Troubleshooting
- 401: invalid API key to your Faxbot API (set `API_KEY` and send `X-API-Key`).
- 413: file too large → raise `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`.
- 415: unsupported file type → only PDF/TXT.
- Sinch API errors: verify Project ID, API key/secret, and region.

Diagnostics
- Admin → Tools → Tunnels → Run Sinch Diagnostics
- API: `GET /admin/diagnostics/sinch`
  - Checks DNS resolution, OAuth/basic auth reachability, and v3 path compatibility.

Implementation notes
- The outbound adapter prefers the two‑step upload + send flow with multipart fallback.
- The client automatically tries unversioned and `/v3` paths, and both unscoped and project‑scoped endpoints.
