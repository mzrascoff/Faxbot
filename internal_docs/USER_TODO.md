# User TODOs for Local Env and Scripts

Purpose: Track items that block automated env checks or could cause confusion when running scripts/tests locally. None of these are required for the current pytest suite (all tests pass), but they improve reliability of scripts and readiness checks.

- Quote FAX_HEADER value in `.env` so shell sourcing works
  - Current: FAX_HEADER=Faxbot Demo
  - Recommended: FAX_HEADER="Faxbot Demo"
  - Why: `scripts/load-env.sh` sources the file; unquoted spaces turn the trailing word into a command and break the script.

- Fix timezone format in `.env`
  - Current: TZ=Denver/America
  - Recommended: TZ=America/Denver
  - Why: Standard tz database format avoids downstream surprises.

- Remove duplicate FAX_BACKEND entries and choose one
  - Current: FAX_BACKEND appears twice (`sip` earlier, `sinch` later). The last one wins, but it's confusing.
  - Recommended: keep a single line with your intended backend.

- Use distinct secrets for AMI vs internal Asterisk→API posts
  - Current values suggest the same secret might be reused.
  - Recommended: set `ASTERISK_AMI_PASSWORD` and `ASTERISK_INBOUND_SECRET` to different strong values.

- When using phaxio backend in production, ensure HTTPS
  - Set `PUBLIC_API_URL` to an HTTPS URL and keep `ENFORCE_PUBLIC_HTTPS=true` (default). For local non‑TLS testing, temporarily set `ENFORCE_PUBLIC_HTTPS=false`.

Notes
- Test status: `pytest` is fully green locally (21 passed). No tests currently require provider credentials beyond defaults.
- I will keep this list updated as I encounter anything that blocks automated runs.
